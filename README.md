**Introduction and Purpose of Website:**  

This website was created by Naaba Abdul-Takilu a student of the University of Ghana to improve on the management and flexibility of the Computer Science Department of the University of Ghana. 

Each page is dedicated to various aspect of the department.
These aspects include: Home, About Us, Research, Staff, Contact Us, Events, Resources and others.
This Interim Assessment was created with the purpose of testing our individual understanding from learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.

The website is made of simple clear text. The user-friendly language used is English.
The website was entirely made with HTML and CSS only.
It seeks to simplify the reachability to the department and its services without necessarily having to go to the department.


**How To Clone and Setup the Project:**
1. Fork the repository:
   A public repository is created, we must fork the repository to our own GITHUB account to begin working on the project.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine

3. Use the right git command to add files, commit, and push those files to your remote repository after every significant change in the project.

To add all modifying files, the command git add -A is used, to commit the command git commit -m is used and finally to push to github the command git push -u is used
If the files to be committed have no significant change like untracked files and just need to be modified the command commit -a -m is used.

**What i have learnt from this project:**  
I have gained much knowledge and eperience about HTML and CSS. I explored critical techniques and deeper understanding on how to start
a website through to the end. I mastered most of the a lot and I have seen my weak points and would work on them respectively
